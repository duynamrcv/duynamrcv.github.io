I received the B.Eng. degree in *Robotics Engineering*, and M.Sc. degree in *Electronics Engineering* in 2022, and 2024, respectively, both from [Vietnam National University](https://www.vnu.edu.vn/home/), Hanoi, Vietnam. I am currently an Automotive Embedded Engineer at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/), responsible for the control and planning modules for autonomous vehicles.

An updated version of my CV can be found [here](/files/cv.pdf).

# Research interests

My research directions evolve around the efficient coordination of multi-robot systems by considering robustness, scalability, and safety. More specifically, my interests include:
- Multi-robot systems
- Learning and optimal control
- Motion planning
