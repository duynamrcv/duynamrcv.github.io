I am currently a Ph.D. student in *Automatic Control* at the Division of Automatic Control, Department of Electrical Engineering, [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en/), Linköping, Sweden, where I focus on the Control of Multi-agent Networks. I received my B.Eng. degree in *Robotics Engineering* in 2022 and my M.Sc. degree in *Electronics Engineering* in 2024, both from the [University of Engineering and Technology](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/), Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam.

My research interests include networked multi-agent systems, learning-based control, and optimal control.

An updated version of my CV can be found [here](/files/cv.pdf).
