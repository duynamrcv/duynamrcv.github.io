I am a Ph.D. student in *Automatic Control* at the Division of Automatic Control (RT), Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en/), Linköping, Sweden. My main supervisor is [Prof. Claudio Altafini](https://liu.se/medarbetare/claal20).

I received a B.Eng. degree in *Robotics Engineering* in 2022 and a M.Sc. degree in *Electronics Engineering* in 2024, from the [University of Engineering and Technology](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/), Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam. My supervisors were [Dr. Hung Pham Duy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3el0x_oAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Manh Duong Phung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JE-a1MkAAAAJ&hl=en). In November 2024, I successfully defended my M.Sc. thesis, titled "Distributed Control strategies for Changing Multiple UAV Formation".

My research interests are in the area of network science, multi-agent systems, and control.
